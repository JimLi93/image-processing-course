## Project05-01 : Noise Generators

Run the program and it will display 5 images with different noise added.
* None
* Guassian noise
* Salt&pepper `(Pp = 0.1, Ps = 0  )`
* Salt&pepper `(Pp = 0  , Ps = 0.1)`
* Salt&pepper `(Pp = 0.1, Ps = 0.1)`



## Project05-03 : Periodic Noise Reduction Using a Notch Filter

Run the program and it will display 6 images with psnr.
* Original image
* Add sine noise
* Convert to frequency domain
* Notch filter implemented by `notchfiltering()`
* Filter the image using Notch filter in frequency domain
* Convert back to spatial domain

## Project05-04 : Parametric Wiener Filter

Run the program and it will display 6 images with psnr.
* Original image
* Apply motion blur
* Add Guassian noise
* Apply wiener filter with `k = 0.1`
* Apply wiener filter with `k = 0.01`
* Apply wiener filter with `k = 0.001`
